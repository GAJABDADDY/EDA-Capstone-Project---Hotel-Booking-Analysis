# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): High Cancellation Rates in City and Resort Hotels

## Project Objective
The main objective of this project is to analyze and identify factors contributing to high cancellation rates in City and Resort Hotels. Using Python, we performed data cleaning, transformation, and visualizations to gain valuable insights into this problem and propose potential solutions for improvement.

## Technologies Used
- Python for data cleaning, transformation, and analysis
- Google Collab for code execution and documentation
- GitHub for version control and collaboration

## Dataset Description
The dataset used in this project contains information about bookings in City and Resort Hotels, including reservation details, guest demographics, booking channels, and cancellation status. Data cleaning and transformation steps involved handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and creating new features for analysis.

## Analysis and Insights
Key insights and findings from the analysis include:
- Identification of high cancellation rates across City and Resort Hotels
- Analysis of cancellation patterns based on booking channels, guest demographics, and booking lead time
- Comparison of cancellation rates between different hotel types and regions
- Correlation analysis to determine factors influencing cancellation decisions
- Visualization of trends and patterns using interactive charts and graphs

## Proposed Solutions
Based on the insights gained, potential solutions to reduce cancellation rates include:
- Implementing stricter cancellation policies or penalties
- Offering incentives or discounts for non-cancelled bookings
- Improving booking management and forecasting algorithms
- Enhancing customer communication and engagement strategies

## How to Use
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook file using Google collab or any compatible environment.
3. Execute the code cells to reproduce the analysis and visualizations.
4. Review the findings and recommendations presented in the notebook.

## Future Work
Future iterations of this project may include:
- Fine-tuning predictive models to forecast cancellation rates
- Conducting A/B testing for proposed solutions to measure effectiveness
- Integrating real-time data streams for continuous monitoring and analysis
